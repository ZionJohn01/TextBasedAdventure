This is a class project I did for my Intro to Computer Science class. 
The goal was to leverage dictionaries in Python as rooms for moving around in. The game features multiple choices as the player moves through each room. The ultimate goal is to collect all items in the house before eventually reaching the boss room. 
Just a simple little text adventure game.
